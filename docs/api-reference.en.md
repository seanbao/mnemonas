# MnemoNAS API Reference

English | [简体中文](api-reference.md)

This reference describes MnemoNAS REST API conventions, endpoint groups, and request/response shapes. The default base URL is:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Most endpoints use JSON. File upload and download endpoints use file payloads or streamed responses.

JSON request bodies are parsed strictly. Write endpoints reject unknown fields and multiple concatenated JSON values with `400 invalid request body`.

## Authentication

When Web UI/API authentication is enabled, include:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

WebDAV Basic Auth is separate from the Web UI/API JWT flow.

## Response Formats

Most `/api/v1` success responses:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "ok",
  "request_id": "optional",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Most `/api/v1` error responses:

```json
{
  "code": "BAD_REQUEST",
  "message": "error description",
  "details": {},
  "request_id": "optional",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Auth and public-share errors use:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "error description"
  }
}
```

Authenticated share and favorite management endpoints use `success + data (+ message)`. Public share endpoints under `/api/v1/public/shares/*` return raw JSON objects or arrays on success and structured `success: false` errors on failure.

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created |
| `400` | Invalid request |
| `401` | Not authenticated or token expired |
| `403` | Authenticated but forbidden |
| `404` | Not found |
| `409` | Resource conflict or operation not executable |
| `410` | Resource unavailable, expired, disabled, or access limit reached |
| `413` | File too large |
| `429` | Rate limited |
| `500` | Internal error |
| `503` | Service dependency unavailable |

## Warning Header

Some write endpoints may commit the visible mutation but fail a later persistence or cleanup step. They then return a success status with an HTTP `Warning` header, for example:

- `199 MnemoNAS "activity log persistence failed"`
- `199 MnemoNAS "workspace mutation persistence incomplete"`
- `199 MnemoNAS "scrub result persistence incomplete"`
- `199 MnemoNAS "trash restore metadata reconciliation failed"`
- `199 MnemoNAS "delete cleanup incomplete"`
- `199 MnemoNAS "trash delete cleanup incomplete"`

Clients should inspect the HTTP `Warning` header in addition to the JSON body.

## Auth Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/login` | Log in with username and password |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/refresh` | Exchange refresh token for a new access token |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/auth/me` | Get current user |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | Log out |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/download-session` | Create short-lived download-session cookie |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/password` | Change current user's password |

Login request:

```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

Login response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "access_token": "eyJ...",
    "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
    "expires_at": "2024-01-15T10:15:00Z",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "user": {
      "id": "user-123",
      "username": "admin",
      "role": "admin",
      "home_dir": "/"
    }
  }
}
```

Failed login attempts are rate-limited by username and client address. Client address uses the direct peer unless `server.trusted_proxy_hops` is configured and the request comes from a trusted private/loopback proxy.

## Admin User Endpoints

Admin role required.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/users` | List users |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/users` | Create user |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/admin/users/{id}` | Delete user |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/users/{id}/reset-password` | Reset user password |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/admin/users/{id}/status` | Enable or disable user |

User roles are `admin`, `user`, and `guest`. Non-admin users are scoped by `home_dir`.

## System Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | No | Health check |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/version` | Usually no | Version/build info |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/setup/` | Depends on setup state | Initial setup status |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/setup/acknowledge` | Yes | Acknowledge initial info |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/stats` | Yes | Storage statistics |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/diagnostics` | Admin | Diagnostic information |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/metrics` | Admin when auth enabled | JSON metrics |

Prometheus cannot directly scrape `/api/v1/metrics` as native exposition format. Use a JSON exporter or conversion layer.

## File Operations

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/files/{path}` | List directory or get file metadata |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/files/{path}` | Upload or overwrite file |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/files/{path}` | Delete to trash when trash is enabled |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/files-move` | Move or rename resource |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/files-copy` | Copy file or directory recursively |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/download/{path}` | Authenticated file download |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/directories/{path}` | Create directory |

Move request:

```json
{
  "source": "/documents/old.txt",
  "destination": "/documents/new.txt"
}
```

Copy request:

```json
{
  "source": "/documents/report.txt",
  "destination": "/archive/report.txt",
  "overwrite": false
}
```

Some file mutations may return success with a `Warning` header if the file operation succeeded but later metadata, activity, or cleanup work did not fully complete.

## Thumbnails

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/thumbnails/{path}` | Get generated thumbnail for an image or supported preview |

Download-session cookies are used for preview and thumbnail flows where browser media elements cannot attach Authorization headers.

## Version History

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/versions/{path}` | List versions for a file |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/versions/{hash}/restore` | Restore a version to the requested path |

Restore request often includes the target path as a query parameter:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/versions/<hash>/restore?path=/documents/report.txt"
```

## Trash

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/trash` | List trash items |

| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/trash/{id}` | Permanently delete one item |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/trash` | Empty trash |

Trash visibility follows the current user's configured `home_dir` boundary.

## Search

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/search?q={query}` | Search files by name |

Search results are scoped by configured `home_dir`.

| `PUT` | `/api/v1/shares/{id}` | Update share |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/shares/{id}` | Delete share |

Create request:

```json
{
  "path": "/documents/report.pdf",
  "password": "optional-password",
  "expires_at": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",

| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/favorites` | List favorites |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/favorites` | Add favorite |

| `POST` | `/api/v1/maintenance/gc` | Run garbage collection |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/diagnostics-export` | Export diagnostic bundle |

Maintenance endpoints are admin-oriented and may be long-running. The Web UI exposes the same operations from maintenance pages.

## WebDAV

WebDAV is served at:

```text
http://localhost:8080/dav
```

By default it uses Basic Auth with credentials from `[webdav]` or generated credentials in `secrets.json`.

Supported core methods include `OPTIONS`, `PROPFIND`, `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `MKCOL`, `MOVE`, `COPY`, simplified `PROPPATCH`, simplified `LOCK`, and simplified `UNLOCK`.

See [WebDAV compatibility](webdav-compatibility.en.md).

## Error Codes

Common error-code categories:

| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | `UNAUTHORIZED`, `LOGIN_RATE_LIMITED`, `TOKEN_EXPIRED` |
| Request | `BAD_REQUEST`, `INVALID_REQUEST_BODY`, `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| File | `NOT_FOUND`, `CONFLICT`, `FILE_TOO_LARGE` |
| Share | `SHARE_NOT_FOUND`, `SHARE_EXPIRED`, `SHARE_PASSWORD_RATE_LIMITED` |
| Service | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, `INTERNAL_ERROR` |

Use the HTTP status code for broad control flow and the JSON error code for user-facing or branch-specific handling.

## Version Notes

This document describes the current main-branch REST API. Released versions, compatibility notes, and change history are tracked by Git tags and [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.en.md).
